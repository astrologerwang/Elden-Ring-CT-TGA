[Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md)

### Requirements

Cheat Engine: 7.5 or 7.4  
Game: App ver. 1.16

## How to use

### Info

This table is not meant to be used online and you will most likely be banned if you attempt to do so.

### Cheat Table (Windows)

1. Install a supported version of Cheat Engine, see [Installing Cheat Engine](#installing-cheat-engine)
2. Download the [Cheat Table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA/releases)
3. Unpack the .CT file anywhere, a recommendation would be your **My Cheat Tables** folder (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Cheat Tables`)
4. Disable EasyAntiCheat and run the game, see [Disabling EasyAntiCheat](#disabling-easyanticheat)
5. Load the .CT file directly via double-click or selecting it and pressing enter, or launch Cheat Engine and load the .CT file via File->Load or by clicking on the folder icon
6. Activate the "Open" script by ticking its box

### Cheat Table (Linux)

I expect you to already have Steam, Wine, Proton, and the game installed

1. Install a supported version of Cheat Engine, see [Installing Cheat Engine](#installing-cheat-engine)
2. Launch the game at least once via Steam to have your wine prefix set up
3. Install [protonhax](https://github.com/jcnils/protonhax)
4. Download the [Cheat Table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA/releases)
5. Unpack the .CT file anywhere, a recommendation would be somewhere you can easily find within the wine prefix created for the game (e.g. `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1245620/pfx/drive_c/`)
6. In Steam, set the game's launch options to `protonhax init %command%`
7. Run the game via Steam ([Disabling EasyAntiCheat](#disabling-easyanticheat) is optional)
8. Run Cheat Engine via `protonhax run 1245620 /path/to/Cheat\ Engine.exe` in your terminal of choice or put it in a shell script
  (replace `/path/to/` with your actual path to where you installed CE, default should be `~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Cheat\ Engine\ 7.5/Cheat\ Engine.exe`)
9. Load the .CT file via File->Load or by clicking on the folder icon
10. Activate the "Open" script by ticking its box

### Installing Cheat Engine

#### Windows

1. Run Terminal or PowerShell with administrator privileges
2. Install Chocolatey by pasting the following line into either and pressing enter, if you don't already have it:
  `winget install chocolatey`
3. Install Cheat Engine through Chocolatey, using:
  `choco install cheatengine --version=7.5`
  If your terminal doesn't recognise `choco`, restart it

#### Linux

Run [this bash script](https://gist.github.com/Umgak/3ce70343161fe4018fb1b4736005f681) provided by [Umgak](https://github.com/Umgak).  
You can grab it manually from the link or use this command:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/Umgak/3ce70343161fe4018fb1b4736005f681/raw)"
```

Alternatively, you can do it completely manually:
1. Grab the actual installer of Cheat Engine 7.5 from [this link](https://d2oq4dwfbh6gxl.cloudfront.net/f/CheatEngine/1032/CheatEngine75.exe)
2. Run it in your terminal of choice like this:  
  `wine ./CheatEngine75.exe /VERYSILENT /ZBDIST`  

Absolutely make sure to use the command as posted, as not using the extra arguments will result in Cheat Engine's installer triggering its malware behaviour.

If you accidentally ran it incorrectly and you notice weird things, remove the following files:
```
autorun/eatme.lua
autorun/soundextension.lua
autorun/dlls/dnd.dat
```

### Disabling EasyAntiCheat

#### Method 1 - Recommended

1. Unpack `steam_appid.txt` from the [latest release](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA/releases/latest)
2. Locate your Elden Ring folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game` or `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ELDEN RING/Game/`)
3. Move `steam_appid.txt` into the same folder as your Elden Ring executable (`eldenring.exe`)
4.
   - Windows: Run the game via `eldenring.exe`
   - Linux: Add `eldenring.exe` as a non-steam app and run that

#### Method 2 - Compatibility

1. Download LukeYui's Offline Launcher from [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/98) or [Github](https://github.com/LukeYui/launch_modded_eldenring)
2. Locate your Elden Ring folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game` or `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ELDEN RING/Game/`)
3. Move the downloaded .exe file into the same folder as your Elden Ring executable (`eldenring.exe`)
4.
   - Windows: Run the game via the **Offline Launcher**
   - Linux: Add the **Offline Launcher** to Steam as a non-steam app and run that

#### Method 3 - Legacy

1. Locate your Elden Ring folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game` or `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ELDEN RING/Game/`)
2. Rename `start_protected_game.exe` to something else (e.g. `start_protected_game.exe.bak`)
3. Rename `eldenring.exe` to `start_protected_game.exe`
4. Run the game via Steam or `start_protected_game.exe`

## For Contributors

### Development Environment

This table uses [CE2FS](https://pypi.org/project/ce2fs/) to build the table from a file system 
representation. This and some of the TGA-specific build scripts require Python 3.10+. 
You can install the required dependencies using the `./scripts/install_deps.[sh/bat]` script.

### Scripts

#### `install_deps.sh`
- Installs required dependencies to use the other scripts.

#### `build.py`
- Builds the Cheat Engine table in the `dist` folder. You can forward CE2FS arguments to the script. 
- Run with `--fixup` to generate missing XML metadata files after adding scripts / group headers.

#### `check.sh`
- Checks that your `CheatTable` folder is not missing any XML files or important tags within them. 

#### `unpack.sh -o PATH/TO/FOLDER`
- Unpacks the cheat table currently present in the `dist` folder to the file system in `PATH/TO/FOLDER`.
- **WARNING**: Currently, **this wipes the existing contents of `FOLDER/CheatTable`** and cannot "merge" with an existing unpacked table. **DO NOT PASS `-o .`!** Instead, follow the instructions in the [Contribution Workflow](#contribution-workflow) section.

#### `pack_table_files.py`
- Packs the files/folders in `table_files` to the Cheat Engine table files directory (`CheatTable/Files`).
- Files are simply copied, while folders are packed using the TGA archiving protocol (see script). 

### Contribution Workflow

Make a pull request to the `dev` branch of this repository. Run `./scripts/check.sh` or `python build.py --fixup` first to make sure all the required XML files have been generated.

For merging changes made to the built table in Cheat Engine is to run `unpack.sh -o dist`, manually nagivate to the folder where you made your changes, and copy them to the `CheatTable` folder.
